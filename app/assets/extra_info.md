# General Details
I'm Jason, a sophomore studying computer science and engineering at Santa Clara University. 
I'm passionate about being able to make a real-world impact on other people using the skills in software development I have. 
I'm always brainstorming and thinking about new cool projects I can take on, so if anyone has any, they can let me know.
In my free time, you can find me playing basketball with my friends or learning something new. However, if I'm not playing basketball, I could also be watching basketball.
I serve on the board of the Cybersecurity Club on campus at Santa Clara University called BroncoSec. We try to provide knowledge of cybersecurity principles and development practices to those who are interested in the field.

# Nezerac
One of the projects that I developed was during the INRIX X AWS Hackathon in 2024 where myself and other teammates developed an app called Nezerac. Nezerac is an AI agent which helps ease the workload of restaurant owners.  It's use is to make it so closing deals on quality ingredients and other supplies, holding conversations via emails for the restaurant owner, so the owner can focus on serving the customers more than the supply side.
I specifically worked on communication between the frontend and the backend, in writing and processing restaurant data via a lambda function into dynamodb for the AI Agent.

# Visionairy
Another one of the projects I developed called Visionairy was during Hack for Humanity 2025. In this hackathon, my team secured the Most Likely to Be a Startup prize at a hackathon with over 330+ participants from across California. 
I developed the backend using FastAPI, Langchain, Google Cloud Speech-to-Text Models, and Browser Use to automate and ease the booking process of flights for those who are visually impaired.
